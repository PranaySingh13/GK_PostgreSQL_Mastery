===================
PostgreSQL
===================
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over
35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for 
reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

Section 1. Querying Data
===================
Select – show you how to query data from a single table.

Column aliases – learn how to assign temporary names to columns or expressions 
in a query.

Order By – guide you on how to sort the result set returned from a query.

Select Distinct  – provide you with a clause that removes duplicate rows in the 
result set.

===================
PostgreSQL SELECT
===================
PostgreSQL SELECT statement syntax
Let’s start with the basic form of the SELECT statement that retrieves data from 
a single table.

The following illustrates the syntax of the SELECT statement:

SELECT
   select_list
FROM
   table_name;

Let’s examine the SELECTstatement in more detail:

First, specify a select list that can be a column or a list of columns in a table 
from which you want to retrieve data. If you specify a list of columns, you need 
to place a comma (,) between two columns to separate them. If you want to select 
data from all the columns of the table, you can use an asterisk (*) shorthand 
instead of specifying all the column names. The select list may also contain 
expressions or literal values.

Second, specify the name of the table from which you want to query data after 
the FROM keyword.
The FROM clause is optional. If you do not query data from any table, 
you can omit the FROM clause in the SELECT statement.

PostgreSQL evaluates the FROM clause before the SELECT clause in the SELECT statement:
FROM => SELECT

Note that the SQL keywords are case-insensitive. It means that SELECT is equivalent 
to select or Select. By convention, we will use all the SQL keywords in 
uppercase to make the queries easier to read.

PostgreSQL SELECT examples
Let’s take a look at some examples of using PostgreSQL SELECT statement.

We will use the following customer table in the sample database for the demonstration.

1) Using PostgreSQL SELECT statement to query data from one column example
This example uses the SELECT statement to find the first names of all customers 
from the customer table:

SELECT first_name FROM customer;

Notice that we added a semicolon (;) at the end of the SELECT statement. 
The semicolon is not a part of the SQL statement. It is used to signal PostgreSQL 
the end of an SQL statement. The semicolon is also used to separate two SQL 
statements.

2) Using PostgreSQL SELECT statement to query data from multiple columns example
Suppose you just want to know the first name, last name and email of customers, 
you can specify these column names in the SELECT clause as shown in the 
following query:

SELECT first_name,last_name,email FROM customer;

3) Using PostgreSQL SELECT statement to query data from all columns of a table 
example
The following query uses the SELECT statement to select data from all columns 
of the customer table:

SELECT * FROM customer;

In this example, we used an asterisk (*) in the SELECT clause, which is a 
shorthand for all columns. Instead of listing all columns in the SELECT clause, 
we just used the asterisk (*) to save some typing.

However, it is not a good practice to use the asterisk (*) in the SELECT 
statement when you embed SQL statements in the application code like Python, 
Java, Node.js, or PHP due to the following reasons:

Database performance. Suppose you have a table with many columns and a lot of 
data, the SELECT statement with the asterisk (*) shorthand will select data from 
all the columns of the table, which may not be necessary to the application.

Application performance. Retrieving unnecessary data from the database increases 
the traffic between the database server and application server. In consequence,
 your applications may be slower to respond and less scalable.
Because of these reasons, it is a good practice to explicitly specify the column 
names in the SELECT clause whenever possible to get only necessary data from the 
database.

And you should only use the asterisk (*) shorthand for the ad-hoc queries that 
examine data from the database.

4) Using PostgreSQL SELECT statement with expressions example
The following example uses the SELECT statement to return full names and emails 
of all customers:

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name,email FROM customer;

In this example, we used the concatenation operator || to concatenate the first 
name, space, and last name of every customer.We will  use column aliases to assign
expressions more meaningful names.

5) Using PostgreSQL SELECT statement with expressions example
The following example uses the SELECT statement with an expression. It omits 
the FROM clause:
SELECT 5*3;

===================
PostgreSQL Column Alias
===================
A column alias allows you to assign a column or an expression in the select list 
of a SELECT statement a temporary name. The column alias exists temporarily 
during the execution of the query.

The following illustrates the syntax of using a column alias:

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

In this syntax, the column_name is assigned an alias alias_name. The AS keyword is optional so you can omit it like this:

SELECT column_name alias_name
FROM table_name;

The following syntax illustrates how to set an alias for an expression in the 
SELECT clause:

SELECT expression AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

The main purpose of column aliases is to make the headings of the output of a 
query more meaningful.

1) Assigning a column alias to a column example
The following query returns the first names and last names of all customers 
from the customer table.

If you want to rename the last_name heading, you can assign it a new name 
using a column alias like this:

SELECT first_name, last_name AS surname FROM customer;

Or you can make it shorter by removing the AS keyword as follow

SELECT first_name, last_name surname FROM customer;

2) Assigning a column alias to an expression example
The following query returns the full names of all customers. It constructs the 
full name by concatenating the first name, space, and the last name:
Note that in PostgreSQL, you use the || as the concatenating operator that 
concatenates one or more strings into a single string.

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM customer;

3) Column aliases that contain spaces
If a column alias contains one or more spaces, you need to surround it with double quotes like this:

column_name AS "column alias"
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS "Full Name" FROM customer;

Summary
Assign a column or an expression a column alias using the syntax column_name AS 
alias_name or expression AS alias_name.

The AS keyword is optional.

Use double quotes (“) to surround a column alias that contains spaces.

======================
PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause
======================
When you query data from a table, the SELECT statement returns rows in an 
unspecified order. To sort the rows of the result set, you use the ORDER BY 
clause in the SELECT statement.

The ORDER BY clause allows you to sort rows returned by a SELECT clause in 
ascending or descending order based on a sort expression.

The following illustrates the syntax of the ORDER BY clause:

SELECT
	select_list
FROM
	table_name
ORDER BY
	sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC],
        ...
	sort_expressionN [ASC | DESC];

In this syntax:

First, specify a sort expression, which can be a column or an expression, that 
you want to sort after the ORDER BY keywords. If you want to sort the result set 
based on multiple columns or expressions, you need to place a comma (,) between 
two columns or expressions to separate them.

Second, you use the ASC option to sort rows in ascending order and the DESC 
option to sort rows in descending order. If you omit the ASC or DESC option, 
the ORDER BY uses ASC by default.

PostgreSQL evaluates the clauses in the SELECT statment in the following order: 
FROM, SELECT, and ORDER BY

FROM => SELECT => ORDER BY

Due to the order of evaluation, if you have a column alias in the SELECT clause, 
you can use it in the ORDER BY clause.

1) Using PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause to sort rows by one column
The following query uses the ORDER BY clause to sort customers by their first 
names in ascending order

SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer ORDER BY first_name ASC;

Since the ASC option is the default, you can omit it in the ORDER BY clause like 
this
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer ORDER BY first_name;

2) Using PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause to sort rows by one column in descending order
The following statement selects the first name and last name from the customer 
table and sorts the rows by values in the last name column in descending order.

SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer ORDER BY last_name DESC;

3) Using PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause to sort rows by multiple columns
The following statement selects the first name and last name from the customer 
table and sorts the rows by the first name in ascending order and last name 
in descending order

SELECT first_name,last_name FROM customer ORDER BY first_name ASC,last_name DESC;

In this example, the ORDER BY clause sorts rows by values in the first name 
column first. And then it sorts the sorted rows by values in the last name column.
As you can see clearly from the output, two customers with the same first name 
Kelly have the last name sorted in descending order.

4) Using PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause to sort rows by expressions
The LENGTH() function accepts a string and returns the length of that string.

The following statement selects the first names and their lengths. It sorts the 
rows by the lengths of the first names

SELECT first_name, LENGTH(first_name) len FROM customer ORDER BY len DESC;

Because the ORDER BY clause is evaluated after the SELECT clause, the column 
alias len is available and can be used in the ORDER BY clause.

PostgreSQL ORDER BY clause and NULL
In the database world, NULL is a marker that indicates the missing data or the 
data is unknown at the time of recording.

When you sort rows that contains NULL, you can specify the order of NULL with 
other non-null values by using the NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST option of the 
ORDER BY clause:

ORDER BY sort_expresssion [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST]

The NULLS FIRST option places NULL before other non-null values and the NULL 
LAST option places NULL after other non-null values.

In this example, the ORDER BY clause sorts values in the num column of the 
sort_demo table in ascending order. It places NULL after other values.

SELECT num FROM sort_demo ORDER BY num;

So if you use the ASC option, the ORDER BY clause uses the NULLS LAST option by 
default. Therefore, the following query returns the same result

SELECT num FROM sort_demo ORDER BY num NULLS LAST;

To place NULL before other non-null values, you use the NULLS FIRST option

SELECT num FROM sort_demo ORDER BY num NULLS FIRST;

The following statement sorts values in the num column of the sort_demo table in 
descending order
SELECT num FROM sort_demo ORDER BY num DESC;
As you can see clearly from the output, the ORDER BY clause with the DESC option 
uses the NULLS FIRST by default.

To reverse the order, you can use the NULLS LAST option:
SELECT num FROM sort_demo ORDER BY num DESC NULLS LAST;

Summary
Use the ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement to sort rows.

Use the ASC option to sort rows in ascending order and DESC option to sort rows 
in descending order. The ORDER BY clause uses the ASC option by default.

Use NULLS FIRST and NULLS LAST options to explicitly specify the order of NULL 
with other non-null values.
